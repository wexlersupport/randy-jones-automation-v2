I wanted to follow up with the Why's, How's, and What's of your investment portfolio. In previous conversations we discussed how Market Timing, Stock Predicting, and Investment Pundits are the primary causes of investors losing money and not realizing "advertised" returns on stocks. (see Free Market Investing) Investing is a LONG-TERM strategy. However, many people approach it as if it were gambling. Some people win big and most barely break even with that approach. Real market returns come from simply "participating" while "the market" does what it does.</p><p>When we invest, we focus on Access and Control. "When do you need the money?” Building wealth takes time. Most importantly, your family's future is nothing you want to gamble with. As you use your brokerage account to make investments, keep these fundamental rules in mind and remember, short-term investing, i.e. "gambling" is like going to Vegas and What happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas but... What typically stays in Vegas is your Money.</p><p>During our next meeting we will go over your portfolio structure and how it ties into your risk tolerance and goals.</p><p>Thanks so much,</p><br><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Randy Jones</p><p>The Legacy Builder</p><p>Office: 571-375-8031</p><p>Cell: 703-919-6258</p>` },
